"It's been a hard day's night, and I'd been working like a dog It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log But when I get home to you I find the things that you do Will make me feel alright You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything So why on earth should I moan, cos when I get you alone You know I feel OKWhen I'm home everything seems to be right When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeahIt's been a hard day's night, and I'd been working like a dog It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log But when I get home to you I find the things that you do Will make me feel alright owwwSo why on earth should I moan, cos when I get you alone You know I feel OKWhen I'm home everything seems to be right When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeahIt's been a hard day's night, and I'd been working like a dog It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log But when I get home to you I find the things that you do Will make me feel alright You know I feel alright You know I feel alright"
"Anytime at all, anytime at all, anytime at all, all you've gotta do is call, and I'll be there. If you need somebody to love, just look into my eyes, I'll be there to make you feel right, if you're feeling sorry and sad, I'd really sympathize. Don't YOU be sad, just call me tonight. Anytime at all, anytime at all, anytime at all, all you gotta do is call, and I'll be there. If the sun has faded away, I'll try to make it shine. There is nothing I won't do, if you need a shoulder to cry on, I hope it will be mine, call me tonight, and I'll come to you Anytime at all, anytime at all, anytime at all, all you've gotta do is call, and I'll be there. Anytime at all, anytime at all, anytime at all, all you've gotta do is call, and I'll be there. Anytime at all, all you've gotta do is call, and I'll be there."
"I took my troubles down to Madame Rue. You know that gypsy with the gold capped tooth She's got a pad down on 34th and Vine, Selling little bottles of Love Potion #9. I told her that I was a flop with chicks. I've been disgraced since 1956. She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign. She said what you need is Love Potion #9. She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink. She said I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink. It smelled like turpentine, and looked like Indian ink. I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink! I didn't know if it was day or night. I started kissing everything in sight. But when I kissed a cop down on 34th and Vine. He broke my little bottle of Love Potion #9. (instrumental) I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink! I didn't know if it was day or night. I started kissing everything in sight. But when I kissed a cop down on 34th and Vine. He broke my little bottle of Love Potion #9. Love Potion #9... Love Potion #9... Love Potion #9..."

"Hey Jude, don't make it bad. Take a sad song and make it better. Remember to let her into your heart, Then you can start to make it better.Hey Jude, don't be afraid. You were made to go out and get her. The minute you let her under your skin, Then you begin to make it better.And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain, Don't carry the world upon your shoulders. For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool By making his world a little colder.Hey Jude, don't let me down. You have found her, now go and get her. Remember to let her into your heart, Then you can start to make it better.So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin, You're waiting for someone to perform with. And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do, The movement you need is on your shoulder.Hey Jude, don't make it bad. Take a sad song and make it better. Remember to let her under your skin, Then you'll begin to make it Better better better better better better, oh.Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa  hey Jude...  (repeat X number of times)"
"When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now, Will you still be sending me a Valentine,birthday greetings, bottle of wine? If I'd been out 'till quarter to three,would you lock the door? Will you still need me, will you still feed me, When I'm sixty-four?Hmm------mmm---mmmh. You'll be older, too.Aaah, and if you say the word, I could stay with you.I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone. You can knit a sweater by the fireside, sunday mornings, go for a ride. Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more? Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wightif it's not to dear. We shall scrimp and save. Ah, grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck, and Dave.Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view. Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away. Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more. Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?by John Lennon/Paul McCartney"

"He had plastic bags wrapped round his shoes He was covered with the evening news He had a pair of ol' wool socks on his hands The bank sign was flashing 5 below It was freezing rain and spitting snow he was curled up behind some garbage cans i was afraid that he was dead i gave him a gentle shake when he opened up his eyes i said ol' man are you ok?... he said...I just climed out of a cotton wood tree i was running from some honey bees drip drying in the summer breeze after jumping  in the calacoe creek i was walking down an old dirt road passed a field of hay that had just been mowed man i wish you'd just left me alone cuz i was almost homeand he said i had just coming round the barn bout time you grabbed my arm when i heard momma holla son hurry up i was close enough from my own nose to smell fresh cogger on the stove and i saw daddy loadin' up the truck game polls on the tail gate bobbers blowing in the wind Since July of '55 that's as close as I've been...(chorus)I said ol' man you're gonna freeze to death let me drive you to the mission he said, ""Boy if you'd left me alone right now I'd be fishing...(Chorus)"

"I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood? She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chairI sat on the rug, biding my time, drinking her wine We talked until two and then she said, ""It's time for bed""She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bathAnd when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown So I lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood?"

"Well let me tell you well no chick made could be the same as Sweet Georgia Brown. Crazy feet that dance so neat has sweet Georgia Brown. Fella's sigh, and even cry for sweet Georgia Brown. I tell you just why you know I don't lie.It's been said she knocks them dead in any old town. Since she came right it's a shame how she brings them down. In Liverpool she even dare to critize the Beatles' hair. With their whole fanclub standing there I mean sweet Georgia Brown.I say this group is absolutely marvellous with the piano, don't you think so. Not too commercial, boys, not too commercial!When it comes to music Sweet Georgia is known to mind, Don't buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine Snap chicks cry, they want to die when Georgie does the twist I never would try to tell you just why. Use your imagination Theres a DJ crazy for her living in out home town since she came it's a shame she turns him down records that she can get are records, they ain't sent him yet Carolina may have Dina, but that don't have Georgia Brown.Oh that sweet Georgia, Yeah yeah yeah I mean Brown, oh oh oh. Sweet Georgia Brown."

"We were talking about the space between us all And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away We were talking about the love we all could share When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love With our love, we could save the world, if they only knewTry to realise it's all within yourself No one else can make you change And to see you're really only very small And life flows on within you and without youWe were talking about the love that's gone so cold And the people who gain the world and lose their soul They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find Peace of mind is waiting there And the time will come when you see we're all one And life flows on within you and without you"

But the fool on the hill sees the sun going downand the eyes in his head see the world spinning `round.And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do and he never shows his feelings But the fool on the hill sees the sun going downand the eyes in his head see the world spinning `round.He never listens to them he knows that they`re the fool they don`t like him.

"Steek 'm op, steek 'm in je mond en begin te roken, smoken en haal 'm in je longen en als je net bent begonnen dan voel je dat de stress wel wordt verdrongen. Door die blunt straight to the point, een splunt, een stikkie of liever een joint. Van harddrugs heb ik geen hoge dunk ik rook alleen skunk, dus noem me geen junk punt Pak het op, rol het op, steek'm op en rook 'm op je passed 'm door en tikt erop en opeens dan is ie op. Hasj & Weed wiede wiede wiet, je ruikt hem wel je rookt hm niet. Ben je stoned en word je dronken je hart gaan bonken, nu ben je stronken. Je taaie kwaaie moet zich ontlaaien, dus het wordt weer tijd om een joint te draaien.Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Rol 'm op en steek m op en rook 'm op ja!Waar King woont wordt wied gekloond, dus nu wordt hij stoned, beloond en bekroond. Een puur natuur kuur van een uur, van King Arthur is niet zo duur. Eigen teeltje, want dat scheelt je toch een geeltje of een meier, we worden higher, het maakt ons blijer, en als ik ga vrijen dan blijf ik glijen. King's plantage wordt een ravage, als we hem oogsten worden we het hoogste. M'n plantjes worden dope, m'n plantjes worden doper, je kan wel naar de coffeeshop maar dit is goedkoper. Deze week is spacecake week, door King gekweekt dus Def bezweek. Bij elk trekkie denkt ie aan een plekkie voor een stekkie ik rol hem in een shaggie en dan voel ik me te gekkie!Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Rol 'm op en steek m op en rook 'm op ja!Ben je blowrijp, pak de blowpijp, en zuig er aan zoals je hoofd-pijpt. Kom is hier griet, en proef m'n wiet, jij zuigt me joint en ik zuig je tiet. Geen slet in m'n bek met een sigaret want ik rook alleen met vol pret ik geniet ervan zoveel ik kan, want bemoeierige bitchen houden we niet van. Zotte teksten, ik zal er in flexen om daarna met de posse te relaxen. Rook je een joint dan voel je je space, maar met de pijp krijg je echt hoogtevrees.

I got no mummy's kisses I got no daddy's smile. Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child.No mummy's arms to hold me or sue me when I cry, 'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome I wish that I could die. I'll walk the streets of heaven where all blinds can see.And just like for the other kids it will be a home for me.I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child. Just like the flowers I'm growing wild.

Ev'ryone I know is sure it shines for you. Even in my dreams I look into your eyes, Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise. Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through.It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one. When other lovers are gone, we'll live on. We'll live on.Nobody I know could love me more than you. You can give me so much love it seems untrue. Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree and then when you've heard him see if you agree. Nobody I know could love you more than me."

"Picture yourself in a boat on a river, With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, And she's gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies, Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, That grow so incredibly high. Newpaper taxis appear on the shore, Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, And you're gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Picture yourself on a train in a station, With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle, The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes."

Sunrise doesn't last all morning A cloudburst doesn't last all day Seems my love is up And has left you with no warning But it's not always going to be this grey All things must pass All things must pass awaySunset doesn't last all evening A mind can blow those clouds away After all this my love is up And must be leaving It has not always been this greyAll things must pass All things must pass awayAll things must pass None of life's strings can last So I must be on my way And face another dayNow the darkness only stays at nighttime In the morning it will fade away Daylight is good At arriving at the right time It's not always going to be this greyAll things must pass All things must pass away All things must pass All things must pass away
