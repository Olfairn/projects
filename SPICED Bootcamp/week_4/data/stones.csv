"I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction 'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try I can't get no, I can't get no When I'm drivin' in my car, and the man come on the radio He's tellin' me more and more about some useless information Supposed to fire my imaginationI can't get no. Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey That's what I say I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction 'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try I can't get no, I can't get noWhen I'm watchin' my TV and a man comes on and tell me How white my shirts can be But, he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke The same cigarettes as meI can't get no. Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey That's what I say I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction 'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try I can't get no, I can't get noWhen I'm ridin' round the world, and I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that And I'm tryin' to make some girl, who tells me Baby, better come back maybe next week 'Cause you see I'm on a losing streak I can't get no. Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey That's what I say. I can't get no, I can't get no I can't get no satisfaction, no satisfaction No satisfaction, no satisfaction"
"I see a red door and I want to paint it black No colors anymore I want them to turn blackI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes I have to turn my head until my darkness goesI see a line of cars and they're all painted black With flowers and my love both never to come backI see people turn their heads and quickly look away Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry dayI look inside myself and see my heart is black I see my red door and it has been painted blackMaybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is blackNo more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue I could not foresee this thing happening to youIf I look hard enough into the settin' sun My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comesI see a red door and I want it painted black No colors anymore I want them to turn blackI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes I have to turn my head until my darkness goesHmm, hmm, hmm,...I wanna see it painted, painted black Black as night, black as coalI wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted blackYeah!"

"Sun turnin' 'round with graceful motion We're setting off with soft explosion Bound for a star with fiery oceans It's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from homeFreezing red deserts turn to dark Energy here in every part It's so very lonely, you're six hundred light years from homeIt's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from homeBell flight fourteen you now can land Seen you on Aldebaran, safe on the green desert sand It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home"

Let's take a walk Just you and me And talk of days gone by Across the fields Under the trees Let's speak of you and I While the whole world Was wondering We walked a steady line When all our friends Were wavering We kept tryingNow we're always suffering Already lost Always suffering Already lostRemember when On summer days I would sing a lovers song How you would smile Shower me with praise And the sun shined onNow the rain is falling slow And the nights grow long And the train Cries out so hauntingly She is goneNow we're always suffering Already lost Always suffering Already lostPlease take these flowers Smell the perfume Let your soul come alive Let there be hope Hope in your heart That our love may reviveFor life is but a chance On a wind swept hill And the seeds of love Are swirling above Let them be stillNow we're always suffering Already lost Always suffering Already lost

"Went out walkin' through the wood the other day and the world was a carpet laid before me The buds were bursting and the air smelled sweet and strange and it seemed about a hundred years agoMary and I, we would sit upon a gate, just gazin' at some dragon in the sky What tender days, we had no secrets hid away, well, it seemed about a hundred years agoNow all my friends are wearing worried smiles, living out a dream of what they was Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up?Wend out walkin' through the wood the other day, can't you see the furrows in my forehead? What tender days, we had no secrets hid away, now it seems about a hundred years agoNow if you see me drinkin' bad red wine, don't worry 'bout this man that you love Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up?You're gonna kiss and say good-bye, yeah, I warn you You're gonna kiss and say good-bye, yeah, I warn you You're gonna kiss and say good-bye, oh Lord, I warn you, and please excuse me while I hide away Call me lazy bones, ain't got no time to waste away, lazy bones ain't got no time to waste away Don't you think it's just about time to hide away?

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.I see a line of cars and their all painted black. With flowers and my love both never to come back. I see people turn their heads and quickly look away. Like a new born baby it just happens every day.I look inside myself and see my heart is black. I see my red door I must have it painted black. maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts. it's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.no more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue. I could not foresee this happening to you. if I look hard enough into the setting sun. my love will laugh with me before the morning comes.I see a red door and I want it painted black no colors anymore I want them to turn black. I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes. I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.*humming*I want to see it painted, paint it black, black as night, black as coal, I want to see the sun, blotted out from the sky I want to see it painted, paint it black **more humming**"

"(Dylan)Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair, Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline, Remember me to one who lives there. She once was a true love of mine.Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm, When the rivers freeze and summer ends, Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm, To keep her from the howlin' winds.Please see for me if her hair hangs long, If it rolls and flows all down her breast. Please see for me if her hair hangs long, That's the way I remember her best.I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all. Many times I've often prayed In the darkness of my night, In the brightness of my day.So if you're travelin' in the north country fair, Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline, Remember me to one who lives there. She once was a true love of mine."

Did you ever feel the pain That He felt upon the cross Did you ever feel the knife Tearing flesh that's oh so soft Did you ever touch the night Did you ever count the cost Do you hide away the fear Put down paradise as lostYou're blinded by rainbows Watching the wind blow Blinded by rainbows Do you dream at night Do you sleep at night I doubt itDid you ever feel the blast As the Semtex bomb goes off Do you ever hear the screams As the limbs are all torn off Did you ever kiss the child Who just saw his father shot Do you ever shed a tear As the war drags on and onDo you ever touch the night Or is it just another job Do you fear the final hours Put down paradise as lostBlinded by rainbows And faces in windows Blinded by rainbows Do you dream at night Do you sleep at night I doubt itDo you ever fear the night Could it be the war is lost Do you fear the final hours Do you kneel before the crossYou're blinded by rainbows And I'm watching the wind blow Blinded by rainbows Do you dream at night Do you scream at night do you smell of fear Is your conscience clear Are you caked in sweatAre your clothes all wet Do you see the light Is the end in sight See the face of Christ Enter paradise I doubt it
"The queen of the Nile She laid o her throne And she was drifting downstream On a barge that was burnished with gold Royal purple the sails So sweetly perfumed And poor Mark Antony's Senses were drowned And his future was doomedHe was blinded by love The Philistines paid For Samson's blind rage The secret that two lovers share Should never have been betrayedHe was blinded by love He was blinded by loveNow it's no use crying or weeping You better lock up your soul for safe keeping Promise meThe poor Prince of Wales He gave up his crown All for the trivial pursuit of A parvenu second-hand lady So lovers beware If you lose your heart Careful now, don't lose your mind Don't mortgage your soul to a strangerDon't be blinded by love Don't be blinded by love Blinded by love Blinded by love"
