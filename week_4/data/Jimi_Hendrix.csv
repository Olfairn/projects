(No!)Not your steppin' stone,Not your steppin' stone,When I first met you, girl, you didn't have no shoes,But, now you're walking around like you're front page news,You've been awful careful 'bout the friends you choose,But, you won't find my name in your book of ""Who's Who"".I said, I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone, (No, girl, not me!)I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone. (No!)Not your steppin' stone,I'm not your steppin' stone,Not your steppin' stone,Not your steppin' stone,Not your steppin' stone,Not your steppin' stone,No, girl, I'm not your steppin' stone,Not your steppin' stone,Not your steppin' stone,Not your steppin' stone,"

"Angel came down from heaven yesterdayShe stayed with me just long enough to rescue meAnd she told me a story yesterday,About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue seaAnd then she spread her wings high over meShe said she's gonna come back tomorrowAnd I said, ""Fly on my sweet angel,Fly on through the sky,Fly on my sweet angel,Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side""Sure enough this morning came unto meSilver wings silhouetted against the child's sunriseAnd my angel she said unto me,""Today is the day for you to riseTake my hand, you're gonna be my man,You're gonna rise""And then she took high over yonderAnd I said, ""Fly on my sweet angel,Fly on through the sky,Fly on my sweet angel,Forever I will be by your side"""
There must be some kind of way out of hereSaid the joker to the theifThere's too much confusionI can't get no reliefBusiness men they drink my winePlowmen dig my earthNone will level on the wineNobody of it is worthNo reason to get exitedThe thief he kindly spokeThere are many here among usWho feel that life is but a jokeBut you and I we've been through thatAnd this is not our fateSo let us talk falsely nowThe hour's getting lateAll along the watchtowerThe princess kept the viewWhile all the women cameAnd went bare feet servants tooOutside in the cold distanceA wild cat did growlTwo riders were aproachingAnd the wind began to howl
"Down the street you can hear her scream ""you're a disgrace""As she slams the door in his drunken face,And now he stands outside and all the neighbours start to gossip and drool.He cries ""Oh girl, you must be mad,What happened to the sweet love you and me had?""Against the door he leans and starts a scene,And his tears fall and burn the garden green.And so castles made of sand, fall in the sea, eventually.A little Indian brave who before he was ten, played war games inthe woods with his Indian friends, and he built a dream that when hegrew up, he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief.Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrowHe would sing his first war song,And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,Suprise attack killed him in his sleep that nightAnd so castles made of sand, melts into the sea eventually.There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a soundAnd she wished and prayed she would stop living, so she decided to die.She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled""You won't hurt me no more.""But then a sight she'd never seen made her JUMP AND SAY""Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way""And it really didn't have to stop...it just kept on going.And so castles made of sand slips into the sea,Eventually"

"Waterfall, nothing can harm me at all,my worries seem so very smallwith my waterfall.I can see my rainbow calling methrough the misty breezeof my waterfall.Some people say day-dreaming'sfor the lazy minded foolswith nothing else to do.So let them laugh, laugh at me,so just as long as I have youto see me through,I have nothing to lose 'long as I have you.Waterfall, don't ever choose your ways.Come with me for a million days,Oh, my waterfall."

"I just want to talk to you. I won't uh, do you no harm,I just want to know about your different lives, onthis here people farm.I heard some of you got your families, living incages tall & cold,And some just stay there and dust away, past theage of old.Is this true? Please let me talk to you.I just wanna know about, the rooms behindyour minds,Do I see a vacuum there, or am I going blind?Or is it just remains from vibrations and echoeslong ago,Things like 'Love the World' and 'Let your fancyflow',Is this true? Please let me talk to you. Let metalk to you.I have lived here before, the days of ice,And of course this is why I'm so concerned,And I come back to find the stars misplacedand the smell of a world that has burned.The smell of a world that has burned.Well, maybee, maybe it's just a change ofclimate.I can dig it, I can dig it baby, I just want to see.So where do I purchase my ticket,I would just like to have a ringside seat,I want to know about the new Mother Earth,I want to hear and see everything,I want to hear and see everything,I want to hear and see everything.Aw, shucks,If my daddy could see me now."

After all the jacks are in their boxes and the clowns have all gone to bedYou can hear happiness staggering on down the streetFootprints dressed in red and the wind whispers maryA broom is drearily sweeping up the broken pieces of yesterday's lifeSomewhere a queen is weeping somewhere a king has no wifeAnd the wind it cries maryThe traffic lights they turn of blue tomorrowAnd shine their emptiness down on my bedThe tiny island sails downstream cause the life that lived is is deadAnd the wind screams maryWill the wind ever remember the names it has blown in the pastAnd with this crutch it's old age and it's wisdomIt whispers no this will be the lastAnd the wind cries mary
