"Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateauSome belong to strangers and some to folks you knowHoly ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sandTo beautify the foothills and shake the many handsThe nothing on the top but a bucket and a mopAnd an illustrated book about birdsYou see a lot up there but don't be scaredWho needs action when you got wordsWhen you've finished with the mop then you can stopAnd look at what you've doneThe plateau's clean, no dirt to be seenAnd the work it was funThe nothing on the top but a bucket and a mopAnd an illustrated book about birdsYou see a lot up there but don't be scaredWho needs action when you got wordsWell the many hands began to scan around for the next plateauSome said it was in Greenland and some say MexicoOthers decided it was nowhere except for where they stoodBut those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they couldOriginally by the Meat Puppets"

"Fight tuberculosis, folks."" Christmas Eve, an oldjunkie selling Christmas seals on North Park Street.The ""Priest,"" they called him. ""Fight tuberculosis, folks.""People hurried by, gray shadows on a distant wall.It was getting late and no money to score.He turned into a side street and the lake wind hit him like a knife.Cab stop just ahead under a streetlight.Boy got out with a suitcase. Thin kid in prep school clothes,familiar face, the Priest told himself, watching from the doorway.""Remindsme of something a long time ago."" The boy, there, with his overcoatunbuttoned, reaching into his pants pocket for the cab fare.The cab drove away and turned the corner. The boy went insidea building. ""Hmm, yes, maybe"" - the suitcase was there in the doorway.The boy nowhere in sight. Gone to get the keys, most likely,have to move fast. He picked up the suitcase and started for the corner.Made it. Glanced down at the case. It didn't look like the case the boy had,or any boy would have. The Priest couldn't put his finger on what was soold about the case. Old and dirty, poor quality leather, and heavy.Better see what's inside. He turned into Lincoln Park, found anempty place and opened the case. Two severed human legs that belonged toa young man with dark skin. Shiny black leg hairs glittered in thedim streetlight. The legs had been forced into the case and he had to usehis knee on the back of the case to shove them out. ""Legs, yet,""he said, and walked quickly away with the case.Might bring a few dollars to score. The buyer sniffed suspiciously.""Kind of a funny smell about it."" ""It's just Mexican leather.""""Well, some joker didn't cure it.""The buyer looked at the case with cold disfavor.""Not even right sure he killed it, whatever it is.Three is the best I can do and it hurts. But since this is Christmasand you're the Priest..."" he slipped three bills under the table into thePriest's dirty hand. The Priest faded into the street shadows, seedyand furtive. Three cents didn't buy a bag, nothing less than a nickel.Say, remember that old Addie croaker told me not to come back unlessI paid him the three cents I owe him. Yeah, isn't that a fruit for ya,blow your stack about three lousy cents.The doctor was not pleased to see him.""Now, what do you WANT? I TOLD you!""The Priest laid three bills on the table. The doctor put themoney in his pocket and started to scream.""I've had TROUBLES! PEOPLE have been around!I may lose my LICENSE!"" The Priest just sat there, eyes, old and heavy withyears of junk, on the doctor's face.""I can't write you a prescription."" The doctor jerked open a drawerand slid an ampule across the table. ""That's all I have in the OFFICE!""The doctor stood up. ""Take it and GET OUT!"" he screamed, hysterical.The Priest's expression did not change.The doctor added in quieter tones, ""After all, I'm a professional man,and I shouldn't be bothered by people like you.""""Is that all you have for me? One lousy quarter G? Couldn't you lendme a nickel...?"" ""Get out, get out, I'll call the police I tell you.""""All right, doctor, I'm going."" Of course it was cold and far to walk,rooming house, a shabby street, room on the top floor.""These stairs,"" coughed the Priest there, pulling himself up along thebannister. He went into the bathroom, yellow wall panels,toilet dripping, and got his works from under the washbasin.Wrapped in brown paper, back to his room, get every drop in the dropper.He rolled up his sleeve. Then he heard a groan from next door,room eighteen. The Mexican kid lived there, the Priest had passed him onthe stairs and saw the kid was hooked, but he never spoke, because hedidn't want any juvenile connections, bad news in any language.The Priest had had enough bad news in his life.He heard the groan again, a groan he could feel, no mistaking that groanand what it meant. ""Maybe he had an accident or something.In any case, I can't enjoy my priestly medications with that sound comingthrough the wall."" Thin walls you understand. The Priest put down hisdropper, cold hall, and knocked on the door of room eighteen.""Quien es?"" ""It's the Preist, kid, I live next door.""He could hear someone hobbling across the floor.A bolt slid. The boy stood there in his underwear shorts, eyes black withpain. He started to fall. The Priest helped him over to the bed.""What's wrong, son?"" ""It's my legs, senor, cramps, and now I am withoutmedicine."" The Priest could see the cramps, like knots of wood therein the young legs, dark shiny black leg hairs.""A few years ago I damaged myself in a bicycle race,it was then that the cramps started."" And now he has the leg cramps backwith compound junk interest. The old Priest stood there, feeling the boygroan. He inclined his head as if in prayer, went back and got his dropper.""It's just a quarter G, kid."" ""I do not require much, senor.""The boy was sleeping when the Priest left room eighteen.He went back to his room and sat down on the bed.Then it hit him like heavy silent snow. All the gray junk yesterdays.He sat there received the immaculate fix. And since he was himself a priest,there was no need to call one."

"Hey fellas have you heard the news?You know that Annie's back in town.It won't take long just watch and see,All the fellas lay their money downHer style is new but the face is the same,As it was so long ago.But from her eyes a different smile,Like that of one who knows.Well it's been ten years and maybe more,Since I first set eyes on you.The best years of my life gone by,Here I am alone and blue.Some people cry and some people die,By the wicked ways of love.But I'll just keep on rolling alongWith no grace from the Lord abovePeople talking all around,About the way you left me flat.I don't care what the people say,I know where their jive is at.One thing I do have on my mind,If you can clarify please do,It's the way you call me by another guy's name,When I try to make love to you.Work so hard I couldn't unwind,Get some money saved.Abuse my love a thousand times,However hard I tried.Heartbreaker your time has come,Can't take your evil way.Go away heartbreaker"
